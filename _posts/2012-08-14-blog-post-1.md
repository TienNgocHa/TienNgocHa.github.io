In this blog, we will study analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and
digital-to-analog conversion (DAC). Down the road, we will prove the well-known
Nyquist sampling theorem. 

The starting point is a continuous-time signal $x(t)$. An ADC takes $x(t)$ and
produces a discrete-time signal $x[n]\triangleq x(nT)$, where $T$ is the
*sampling interval*, also known as *sampling period*. It is also
common to talk about the *sampling rate*, which is defined as $1/T$ if
expressed in Hertz and $2\pi/T$ when expressed in radians per second.

Conversely, a DAC takes a sequence $x[n]$ at its input and produces a
continuous-time waveform $\hat{x}(t)$ at its output. Ideally, if the samples
$x[n]$ preserve all the information in $x(t)$, the DAC will be able to
reconstruct $x(t)$, which theoretically can be expressed as $\hat{x}(t)=x(t)$.

Our first goal is to study under which conditions $x(t)$ can be reconstructed
from $x[n]$.

The notation for Fourier transforms of continuous-time and discrete-time signals
throughout this problem is respectively

$$Y(\Omega) \triangleq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} y(t)e^{-j\Omega t}dt, \quad\quad
    Y(e^{j\omega}) \triangleq \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} y[n]e^{-j\omega n}.$$
