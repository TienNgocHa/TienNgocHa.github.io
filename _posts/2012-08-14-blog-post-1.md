In this blog, we will study analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and
digital-to-analog conversion (DAC). Down the road, we will prove the well-known
Nyquist sampling theorem. 

The starting point is a continuous-time signal $x(t)$. An ADC takes $x(t)$ and
produces a discrete-time signal $x[n]\triangleq x(nT)$, where $T$ is the
*sampling interval*, also known as *sampling period*. It is also
common to talk about the *sampling rate*, which is defined as $1/T$ if
expressed in Hertz and $2\pi/T$ when expressed in radians per second.

Conversely, a DAC takes a sequence $x[n]$ at its input and produces a
continuous-time waveform $\hat{x}(t)$ at its output. Ideally, if the samples
$x[n]$ preserve all the information in $x(t)$, the DAC will be able to
reconstruct $x(t)$, which theoretically can be expressed as $\hat{x}(t)=x(t)$.

Our first goal is to study under which conditions $x(t)$ can be reconstructed
from $x[n]$.

The notation for Fourier transforms of continuous-time and discrete-time signals
throughout this problem is respectively

$$
Y(\Omega) \triangleq \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} y(t)e^{-j\Omega t}dt, \quad\quad
    Y(e^{j\omega}) \triangleq \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} y[n]e^{-j\omega n}.
$$

Note the usage of different letters, namely $\Omega$ and $\omega$, in each case.

1. The Dirac comb, also known as a train of deltas or train of impulses, is
  $p(t)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-Tn)$. The ADC conversion can be
  mathematically thought of as a two-step process. First, $x(t)$ is multiplied
  by a Dirac comb. Let $x_c(t)\triangleq x(t)p(t)$, then we have

  $$
  \label{eq:xc}
  \begin{aligned}
  x_c(t) & = x(t)p(t) = x(t) \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(t-Tn) \\
      & = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(t)\delta(t-Tn) \overset{(a)}{=} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x(nT)\delta(t-Tn) \\
      & = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]\delta(t-Tn),
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  where $(a)$ follows the sampling property, which is
  $x(t)\delta(t-t_0)=x(t_0)\delta(t-t_0)$.

2. The second step involves collecting the amplitudes of the resulting deltas to
  extract the sequence $x[n]$. Let us now relate the Fourier transform of
  $x_c(t)$ and that of $x[n]$. 
  
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  X_c(\omega/T) & =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x_c(t)e^{-j(\omega/T) t}dt                                     \\
              & =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]\delta(t-Tn)e^{-j(\omega/T) t}dt \\
              & =\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \delta(t-Tn)e^{-j(\omega/T) t}dt \\
              & \overset{(a)}{=}\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]e^{-j\omega n} = X(e^{j\omega}),
  \end{aligned}
  $$

  where $(a)$ follows the sampling property of the Dirac delta function, which
  is $y(t_0)=\int y(t)\delta(t-t_0)dt$, ($y(t)=e^{-j(\omega/T) t}$ and
  $t_0=Tn$).
