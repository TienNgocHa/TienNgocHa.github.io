In this blog, we will study analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) and
digital-to-analog conversion (DAC). Down the road, we will prove the well-known
Nyquist sampling theorem. 

The starting point is a continuous-time signal $x(t)$. An ADC takes $x(t)$ and
produces a discrete-time signal $x[n]\triangleq x(nT)$, where $T$ is the
\textit{sampling interval}, also known as \textit{sampling period}. It is also
common to talk about the \textit{sampling rate}, which is defined as $1/T$ if
expressed in Hertz and $2\pi/T$ when expressed in radians per second.
